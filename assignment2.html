<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>This assignment is a continuation of the last one; you will be
extending your last assignment to a more useful and more interesting
simulation.</p>
<p>The assignment has a number of parts. The order of the parts below is
reasonable but not necessarily the order in which you should do the
implementation &mdash; you may defer working on a part that appears
earlier in the list to work on one that appears later in the list.</p>

<h2 id="part1">Part 1: Introduce exception-based error-handling</h2>
<p>In Assignment 2, you had the option of handling errors by printing
messages at the point of detection. Make the implementation use
exceptions as covered in class, using the standard error (stderr or
cerr) as your logging mechanism. You should allow the exceptions to
propagate up to the Client layer, except when there is a logical
reason for catching them in the Rep layer (if the Rep could do some
smarter error handling than the Client could).</p>

<h2 id="part2">Part 2: Let activities occur in virtual time</h2>
<p>The Activity Manager allows creation and deletion of activity
objects. When running, it chooses the appropriate next activity and
executes it. By virtual time, we mean that the client will control the
rate of the simulation, by directly setting the current simulation time.
When a new time is received, the simulation will execute until it has
reached the desired time, and then halt and wait for more commands.</p>

<p>Virtual time should be stepped through using hours as the time unit.
Use the double-precision floating-point type for the representation of
hours. Just be sure to understand the idiosyncrasies of floating-point
numbers, and avoid mistakes such as testing for equality or inequality
(<code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>) between the numbers.</p>

<h2 id="part3">Part 3: Implement shipment transfers</h2>
<p>When a shipment arrives on a segment, an attribute-based notification
causes an activity to be enqueued. The activity delays for the proper
amount of time and then uses a timeout notifiee to indicate that the
shipment has been delivered and the segment carrier is free to transport
again.</p>

<p>A shipment has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>A source location and a destination location.</li>
<li>A load of some arbitrary number of packages.</li>
</ul>
<p>A location that receives a shipment acts according to the location
type:</p>
<ul>
<li>A customer location will update transfer statistics if the shipment
is addressed to it; otherwise it will refuse delivery (meaning the
shipment goes back to the previous location). If you prefer, you can instead
implement a routing algorithm that never ships to customer locations other than
 the final shipment destination.</li>
<li>Any other location type attempts to transfer the shipment along a
path that will get it closer to its destination. Every segment has a
capacity attribute, and if the desired segment is
at full capacity, and no suitable alternative can be found,
then the segment refuses delivery. It's up to you
whether this means that the location holds the packages until a segment opens,
or sends them back along the return segment from which they came. 
Statistics are updated in either case.</li>
</ul>

<p>How does a location decide where next to send a shipment? You may use
any scheme you like. One straightforward approach that we suggest is a
route table that uses a spanning tree of every location to determine a
route for any shipment. Describe your algorithm in your README file.
You may assume that once the simulation starts, the network will not change,
so it's OK to perform fairly expensive pre-processing on the network since
the cost will be amortized over the duration of the simulation.</p>

<p>For this assignment, we will only account for virtual time associated
with transporting a shipment along a segment, and we assume that transfer to
a new segment at a location and determination of a route takes
no virtual time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As an example of calculating the virtual time for carrying a
shipment: if a shipment consisting of 200 packages is to be sent over a
400-mile segment using trucks capable of 50 packages and operating at 80
mph, it takes (400 miles)/(80 mph)=5 hours to send 50 packages, so you
can assume that it takes (5 hours)&times;(200/50)=20 hours to send 200
packages. Note, however, that it will take a full 5 hours more for
201 packages, because the trucks would have to make another full trip
just for that last package.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, you must somehow inject shipments into the simulation and
collect statistics for them. To this end, you must extend the attributes
supported by instances of type Customer and any segment type.</p>

<h2 id="part4">Part 4: Implement a real-time Activity Manager</h2>
<p>The real-time activity manager shall be used to advance the virtual
time; that is, the advancement of the clock for your virtual-time
Activity Manager is an activity from the point of view of your real-time
Activity Manager.</p>

<p>The real-time activity manager should advance the virtual time with a
scaling factor; for example, one second of the real time (wallclock
time) per hour of the virtual time.</p>

<p>Like the virtual activity manager, this Activity Manager also allows
creation and deletion of activity objects. When running, it chooses the
appropriate Activity object at the appropriate time and executes it.</p>

<h2 id="part5">Part 5: Run some simulations</h2>
<p>Construct a shipping network with at least four locations, and
confirm that shipments move between them as expected. Run tests with different
segment capacity values to compare your network under light and heavy
congestion. Add a diagram of
this network to your README file, and discuss the tests performed. The
code for this client should be named verification.cpp.</p>

<p>In addition, set up a shipping network with 100 sources and 1
destination. The destination should be connected to a terminal, which is
in turn connected to 10 terminals, each of which is connected to 10
sources. All connections are via truck segments. Have each source send
shipments holding 100 packages to the destination at the normal truck
speed. Run the simulation for a while.</p>

<p>Now, reset the simulation and do the same thing, but vary the
shipment sizes (use a randomly chosen shipment size for each source)
from 1 package to 1,000 packages. Record the results for each case.</p>

<p>Discuss in your README file the level of shipment delivery refusal
observed in each case. The client implementing this test should be
submitted as experiment.cpp. We would like you to include whatever
statistics you think are relevant to your specific implementation,
but at a bare minimum please provide us with the destination's shipments
received and average latency, as well as some sort of measure of segment
performance (an average for each of shipments received and refused, for
example).</p>

<h2 id="part6">Part 6: Explore further extensions</h2>
<p><b>(optional; for extra credit)</b> Email the TAs with ideas for
experiments that you think would be interesting, and implement them.
Some extension topics include: sophisticated routing schemes that take
into account segment speeds and shipping traffic, receipt
acknowledgment, and redelivery requests, methods to handle burstiness of
the traffic, terminal latency modeling, experimenting with different
network topologies, maintaining a trace route in the shipment structure
to be used with probe shipments to determine least congested routes, and
random variations in segment performance. You are not limited to this
list.</p>

<h2 id="part7">Part 7: Group Requirements</h2>
<p>First, groups will be required to implement two different routing algorithms.
Neither of them has to be particularly sophisticated, but we want you to
be able to observe differences in network congestion and latency and
describe in your README file what causes these differences. The routing
algorithm should be specified via a read/write attribute of your
Connectivity object. For example, if your two algorithms are a BFS and
Dijkstra's, the client could say <nobr>connInstance->attributeIs("routing", "Dijkstra")</nobr>
to specify the style of routing. The client should also be able to
query the current routing algorithm via <nobr>connInstance->attribute("routing").</nobr></p>
<p>A second requirement for the group project will be to implement scheduled changes
to the fleet object's attributes. Specifically, we want the client to be able to
indicate during which hours of the day the fleet's attributes will change. For instance,
trucks may be able to travel faster during the night than they can during the day, but
the capacity may be lower due to fewer truckers available to drive those hours. It's up to
you how to implement this and what the interface looks like, but the minimum requirement is
to be able to specify two periods of time, such as one from 8pm to 8am, and one from 8am to
8pm. The client can set different attributes for either of these time periods, and your
activity scheduler should track when these changes occur and set the attributes accordingly.
A simplifying assumption you can make is that the attributes being used as a package departs
from the location will hold throughout the segment traversal. Assume the virtual time is
a 24-hour clock starting at midnight, so for instance, virtual time of 70 would be 10pm.</p>
<p>Last, groups need an additional statistic for each Customer Location
indicating the total cost that was incurred by packages traveling along
the network until they were removed at that Customer Location.</p>


<h2 id="strings">Strings</h2>
<p>The string values from Assignment 2 continue to be a contract between
the rep layer and the client. However, we must add some new strings to
provide the extra functionality for this
assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Locations
<ul>
<li>Type: "Customer"</li>
<li>Source attributes: (a customer only sends shipments if it has valid
values for each of these)
<ul>
<li>"Transfer Rate" (in shipments per day)</li>
<li>"Shipment Size" (in packages)</li>
<li>"Destination" (an absolute name of a location)</li>
</ul>
<li>Destination attributes:
<ul>
<li>"Shipments Received": read-only; the number of shipments destined
for and received by this location</li>
<li>"Average Latency": read-only; the average virtual time it takes a
shipment to make its way from the source to the destination, excluding
refused shipments</li>
<li>"Total Cost": read-only; the total cost of all packages that have been
received by this location (Groups only)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Segments
<ul>
<li>"Shipments Received": read-only</li>
<li>"Shipments Refused": read-only</li>
<li>"Capacity" (in number of shipments): default is 10</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<p> This assignment is extremely open-ended. We won't be as concerned with
exact output or implementation details as we have been, so how you implement
your simulation is completely up to you, however, here are some guidelines
which may be helpful to get you started. <br>
<br>
A customer location should only begin sending shipments once all 3 of the source attributes have been set. A reactor (CustomerReactor) for customer locations that receives notification on "Transfer rate" "Shipment size" and "Destination" would be ideal here. Once all 3 attributes have been set, the customer location should create a new Activity (InjectActivityReactor) that injects shipments into customer location.<br>
<br>
Each location could also have a reactor (LocationReactor) that receives notification on when a shipment arrives, either by the inject activity or from a forward activity. This reactor should find the best segment to enqueue the shipment onto. A segment could also have another reactor (SegmentReactor) that creates and schedules a forwarding activity if necessary. <br>
<br>
A forwarding activity (ForwardActivityReactor) should try to forward a shipment to the next location. If there are any additional Shipments left on the queue, the ForwardActivityReactor should automatically reschedule itself for the next execution.
</p>

<p>Also, you can find source code examples of how to use the Notifiee and Activity interface <a href="files">here.</a> You may use as much or as little code from these examples in your assignment as you wish.</p>

<h2 id="starter_code">Additional starter code</h2>
<p>Start from the code you developed for Assignment 2, and known issues
with that code before going forward. You are encouraged to use the
following files located in the <a href="files/">assignment source
directory</a> for Parts 2 and 4:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activity.h: class Activity, class Activity::Manager
(interfaces)</li>
<li>ActivityImpl.h: class ActivityImpl, class ManagerImpl (stubs
only)</li>
<li>Notifiee.h: class RootNotifiee, class BaseNotifiee (complete)</li>
<li>Nominal.h: Nominal template shown in class</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="clarifications">Select Clarifications from Previous Year</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The difference between the virtual time activity
  manager and the real time activity manager is that the virtual time
  activity manager does not wait (ie make any calls to sleep), while the
  real time activity manager slows down the simulation to a more
  human-preceptible timescale.</li>

This is a project to reimplement a frustrating assignment in C++ for Professor
Cheriton's class (CS249A at Stanford).

The assignment is sourced from http://cs249a.stanford.edu/ I have copied it
down into the assignment directory so that the assignment details last beyond
the quarter in which I took CS249A. (Note: the web pages were available to the
public, and were not behind Web-Auth, so I feel justified storing them in this
repository. Accessed: 1:10am 12/25/11)

In translating this assignment from C++ to Scala, there have been a few
changes. Because I'm not interfacing with a rep-layer as in the assignment,
that has been removed. Further, "introducing exception based handling" has been
removed, because it is also non-sensical, as I used exception-based handling
already (in minimal fashion).

This code is, unfortunately, not my best. Please don't judge me!

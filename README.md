This is a project to reimplement a frustrating assignment in C++ for Professor
Cheriton's class (CS249A at Stanford).

The assignment is sourced from http://cs249a.stanford.edu/ I have copied it
down into the assignment directory so that the assignment details last beyond
the quarter in which I took CS249A.

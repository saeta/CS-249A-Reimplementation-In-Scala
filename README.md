This is a project to reimplement a frustrating assignment in C++ for Professor
Cheriton's class (CS249A at Stanford).

The assignment is sourced from http://cs249a.stanford.edu/ I have copied it
down into the assignment directory so that the assignment details last beyond
the quarter in which I took CS249A. (Note: the web pages were available to the
public, and were not behind Web-Auth, so I feel justified storing them in this
repository. Accessed: 1:10am 12/25/11)

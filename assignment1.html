        <li>9/19/2011: Review Session: Friday, October 21, 4:00PM-5:00PM in
        Skilling 193. As before, this will be televised.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

    <p>In this and subsequent assignments, we are going to investigate the
    simulation of a shipping business. Our simulation is going to simplify this
    domain significantly and focus only on a small aspect of the business.
    Nonetheless, this simulation will help us practice the fundamental
    techniques of the modeling and simulation approach to development.</p>

    <p>The shipping business is a service that transports packages from one
    location to another. Your task is to design and implement a class library
    that enables a client program to specify a configuration and query the
    state of a shipping network. The configuration is specified in terms of
    shipping entities, such as locations or connections, and the relationships
    between them. While designing your library, keep in mind that in later
    assignments you will have to extend it to simulate shipping behavior (i.e.,
    shipments traveling from location to location). You also need to create a
    sample client program that instantiates some connections and locations and
    connects them together.</p>

    <p>You will work in groups of two for this project.  Please be aware that
    Assignment 3 builds on this assignment, so it would be wise to keep the
    same group for both projects.  If you need to help finding a group, post 
    to the class list or the newsgroup, or contact the TAs and we will match 
    you with someone.</p>

    <h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>A <b><i>shipment</i></b> is one or more packages sent as a group.
        All packages in a shipment start in one place and travel to the same
        destination.</li>

        <li>A <b><i>segment</i></b> is a connection from one location to
        another. Each segment has the following attributes:

            <ul>
                <li><b><i>mode</i></b>: The vehicle type associated with the
                segment. In this assignment, the modes are "truck", "boat", or
                "plane".</li>

                <li><b><i>source</i></b>: The location that the segment is
                attached to. Packages transported along this segment originate
                from the source.</li>

                <li><b><i>length</i></b>: The length of the segment in
                miles.</li>

                <li><b><i>return segment</i></b>: The segment going in the
                other direction, i.e., the segment whose source is this
                segment's destination. In this assignment, for example, a road
                between two locations is modeled as two segments, one for each
                direction. Note that a segment can have a different length than
                its return segment, but they must both be of the same
                mode.</li>

                <li><b><i>difficulty</i></b>: A float number between 1.0 and
                5.0 representing the difficulty of traveling along the
                segment.</li>

                <li><b><i>expedite support</i></b>: Whether the segment
                supports optional expedited shipping. Expiditing boosts vehicle
                speed by 30% along the segment but increases the cost per mile
                by 50%.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>A <b><i>location</i></b> is a place where segments converge, such
        as an intermediate stop where a shipment might be transferred from one
        vehicle type to another. Locations can be one of the following:

            <ul>
                <li>A <b><i>customer location</i></b> is a pickup or delivery
                location &mdash; a place where a shipment either enters or
                leaves the transportation network. Customer locations can
                connect to any mode of transportation.</li>

                <li>A <b><i>port</i></b> is a location at which a shipment can
                be transferred between vehicles of different modes (or the same
                mode). For example, a truck can drive to a port and transfer
                its shipment to a boat.</li>

                <li>A <b><i>terminal</i></b> is a location at which a shipment
                is transferred from one segment to another segment of the
                <i>same mode</i>. This means terminals are restricted to only
                having segments of the same mode attached to them.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>A <b><i>fleet</i></b> represents the network-wide information about
        the different modes of transportation. Fleet has the following
        attributes for each mode of transportation:

            <ul>
                <li><b><i>speed</i></b> is the velocity of a vehicle of a given
                mode of transportation, in miles per hour.</li>

                <li><b><i>capacity</i></b> is the number of packages a vehicle
                of a given mode of transportation can carry at a single
                time.</li>

                <li><b><i>cost</i></b> is the cost per mile of using a given
                mode of transportation, in dollars, at segment difficulty 1.0.
                The actual cost of traveling a mile along a segment is
                cost*difficulty.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>A <b><i>path</i></b> is a sequence of locations and the segments
        connecting them.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A shipping network may include any number of the shipping entities,
    where a shipping entity is either a location or a segment.</p>

    <h2 id="querying">Querying the Shipping Network</h2>

    <p>Your library should support the following query types:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b><i>Statistics</i></b>: This tracks two kinds of attributes.
        First, given a shipping entity type, return how many entities of that
        type are present in the network. Second, it needs to be able to return
        the percentage of all segments in the network that support expedited
        shipping. You are <b>required</b> to update these attributes using the
        notification/reactor model as presented in assignment 1.</li>

        <li>
            <b><i>Connectivity</i></b>: There are two query types:

            <ul>
                <li><!--<b>(Group only)</b>--> Given a starting location and a set of attributes with
                constraints, return all paths from the starting location that
                lie within the constraints. For example, the client could
                specify "SFO distance 20 cost 500", and the command should
                return all paths whose end location is 20 miles or less from
                SFO and whose total cost is $500 or less.</li>

                <li><!--<b>(Group only)</b>--> Given a start and end location, 
                return a list of all paths between these two locations. For 
                each path, also return the cost, time, and whether expedite 
                support has been used or not.</li>
<!--
                <li><b>(Individual version only)</b> Given a starting location and
                a distance, return all paths of that distance or less.  For example,
                a connectivity query on starting location "port1" with distance
                "100" should return all paths whose end locations are 100 miles or
                less away from "port1."
-->
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b><i>Fleet</i></b>: Given a transportation mode, return its speed,
        cost, or its capacity.</li>
    </ul>The details of how these queries should be implemented are described
    below.

    <h2 id="layered-structure">Layered Structure</h2>

    <p>We want the shipping system structured in three layers. The top layer is
    the client program that sets up and queries a shipping network. We provide
    a very simple client program to get you going. You also need to write your
    own in order to test your library for more complicated configurations and
    queries.</p>

    <p>The client program can instantiate shipping entities and access or
    change their attributes, but it only knows of each entity by a string name.
    The operations requested by the client program are handled by a middle
    layer. The interface exported by the middle layer to the client program is
    a string-valued service (this interface was chosen for greatest flexibility
    and support for a wide range of user interfaces). We provide the interface
    for this middle layer, and you are responsible for the implementation.</p>

    <p>The operations requested by the middle layer are handled by the lowest
    layer, which we refer to as the "engine." It is this lowest layer that
    keeps all necessary state; e.g., for each port created by the client
    program, there must be an engine object that stores the port's name, the
    segments that list it as a source, and so on. The interface exported by the
    engine layer to the middle layer is private to your library, so you are
    free to design it any way you want, as long as you adhere to the principles
    taught in class. You are responsible for both the interface and
    implementation of the engine layer.</p>

    <h2 id="middle-layer">Middle-Layer Interface</h2>

    <p>We refer to the middle layer as the "rep" layer because it represents
    the client requests to the engine and represents the engine state to the
    client.</p>

    <p>The client program does not directly create or manage engine objects.
    Instead, a client must create and manage Instance objects provided by the
    rep layer. The client program retrieves an Instance object, and then
    reads or writes its attributes through the string-based interface desribed
    below. In other words, Instance objects handle the conversion between the
    string-based interface and the engine objects. Each Instance object has an
    entity type which defines the object's attributes.</p>

    <p>To create a new Instance object, the client program passes the
    Instance's global name and entity type to Instance::Manager::instanceNew().
    If the client attempts to create an instance using instanceNew()
    with a name that already exists, then instanceNew() should return null.
    To get a pointer to an existing Instance object, the client program passes
    the Instance's absolute name to Instance::Manager::instance(). Finally, to
    read or write an attribute for an Instance, the client program uses
    Instance::attribute() and Instance::attributeIs(). Some attributes accept a
    limited set of values. It is up to you to see that these constraints are
    maintained. Invalid writes should be discarded with an error message
    printed to the standard error (stderr or cerr).</p>

    <p>Each entity type can be categorized as a Location, Segment, Statistics,
    Fleet, or Connectivity. The valid attributes for each entity type are listed
    below.</p>

    <h3>Location</h3>

    <p>Entity types: "Customer", "Port", "Truck terminal", "Boat terminal",
    "Plane terminal". Allowed attributes: "segment1", "segment2", "segment3",
    etc.</p>

    <p>Each location must track the segments for which it is the source. The
    client accesses these segments based on a number ID determined by the order
    segments are attached to the location. Suppose we attach "segA", "segB",
    and "segC" to a terminal "myTerm" (in that order).  The command
<pre>
myTerm-&gt;attribute("segment2")
</pre>
    should return "segB". If a
    segment is detached from a location, the segments after it are shifted.
    Continuing the above example, if we detach "segB" from "myTerm", then the
    call
<pre>
myTerm-&gt;attribute("segment2")
</pre> 
    returns "segC" instead. Since the
    segment attribute is determined by order of segment attachment, it is
    read-only. Therefore, to attach a segment to a location, you must use the
    "source" segment attribute listed below.</p>

    <h3>Segment</h3>

    <p>Entity types: "Truck segment", "Boat segment", "Plane segment." Allowed
    attributes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>"source": The global name of the source location.</li>

        <li>"length": In miles, nonnegative, and remember to use the Ordinal
        Value Type.</li>

        <li>"return segment": The global name of the return segment, or the
        empty string (""). If you have 2 segments, seg1 and seg2, and you set
        the return segment of seg1 to seg2, then seg2's return segment should
        also be implicitly set to seg1. If you then set seg1's return segment
        to "", then seg2's return segment should implicitly be set to ""
        also.</li>

        <li>"difficulty": <b><!--(Group only)--></b> A float number between 1.0 and 5.0 representing the
        difficulty of traveling along the segment.</li>

        <li>"expedite support": <!--<b>(Group only)</b>--> Either "yes" or "no."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Statistics</h3>

    <p>Entity type: "Stats." Allowed attributes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Any Location entity type or Segment entity type is a valid
        attribute, and the attribute value is the number of instances of that
        type present in the system. For instance, a read on attribute
        "Customer" must return "2" if there are 2 customer locations in the
        shipping network.</li>

        <li>"expedite percentage": <!--<b>(Group only)</b>--> The percentage of segments in the network
        that support expediting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Connectivity</h3>

    <p>Entity type: "Conn." Allowed attributes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Any string of the form "explore <var>loc0</var> : <var>att0</var>
        <var>v0</var> <var>att1</var> <var>v1</var> ...", where <var>loc0</var>
        is the name of the starting location, each attN is one of the
        attributes listed below, and <var>vN</var> is a value of attN. The
        possible attributes are:

            <ul>
                <li>"distance": The maximum distance of a path</li>

                <li>"cost": <!--<b>(Group only)</b>--> The maximum total cost of the path</li>

                <li>"time": <!--<b>(Group only)</b>--> The maximum total time to send a package along the
                path</li>

                <li>"expedited": <!--<b>(Group only)</b>--> Every segment along the path must have expedite
                support, and cost and time are calculated using expediting.
                This attribute has no value associated with it</li>
            </ul>The attribute value is a string of one or more lines, each of
            which describes a path in the format:
            <pre>

loc0(seg0:len0:seg0') loc1(seg1:len1:seg1') ... locn

</pre>See the <a href="#output-format">Output Format</a> for more details.
        </li>

        <li><!--<b>(Group only)</b>--> Any string of the form "connect <var>loc0</var> : <var>loc1</var>".
        The attribute value is a string of one or more lines, each of which
        describes a path in the format:
            <pre>

cost time expedited; loc0(seg0:len0:seg0') loc1(seg1:len1:seg1') ... locn

</pre>where <var>cost</var> is the path cost, <var>time</var> is the time to
traverse the path, and <var>expedited</var> is either "yes" or "no". The other
values are as stated above. See the <a href="#output-format">Output Format</a>
section for more details.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here are some sample Connectivity queries:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>"explore SFO : cost 500 distance 100 expedited time 12". This
        should return a list of expedited paths that cost &le; $500, and take
        &le; 12 hours to reach locations that are &le; 100 miles from SFO.</li>

        <li>"explore LAX : distance 300 time 5". This should return all paths
        that, without expedite shipping, take &le; 5 hours to get locations
        that are &le; 300 miles from LAX.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A path between two locations is always either entirely expedited
    or entirely unexpedited. This means that if you are exploring
    expedited paths, you should not consider any segment that does not
    support expediting. However, if you are exploring unexpedited
    paths, you can still explore segments that support expediting since
    this only indicates that expediting is an option.</p>

    <h3>Fleet</h3>

    <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <p>Entity type: "Fleet". Allowed attributes: Any string of the form
        "<var>mode</var>, <var>property</var>", where <var>mode</var> is one of
        "Truck", "Boat" or "Plane", and <var>property</var> is either "speed",
        "cost", or "capacity". The attribute value is either the speed in miles
        per hour, cost in dollars per i mile, or capacity in packages,
        respectively. They should be nonnegative and implemented with the
        ordinal type.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Error Handling</h3>

    <p>In general, if the client program requests an incorrect operation, you
    should ignore the request and print an error to stderr. A client operation
    is incorrect in the following cases:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>It involves an incompatible type-attribute pair, such as trying to
        read "speed" from a port.</li>

        <li>It attempts to set an attribute to an invalid value, such as
        Instance::attributeIs("distance", "-1").</li>

        <li>It attempts to connect two incompatible segments, such as trying to
        connect an instance of type "Truck segment" to an instance of type
        "Plane segment."</li>

        <li>All instances should have unique user-defined names. It is an error
        to create an instance using the name of an existing instance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Additional Information</h3>

    <p>Instances of type "Stats", "Conn" or "Fleet" are special in the
    following ways:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>There cannot be more than one "Stats", one "Conn", and one "Fleet"
        Instance. You should create them when Instance::Manager::instanceNew() 
        is called the first time, and then fetch them through Instance::Manager::instance() 
        using their names. If the client attempts to create a second instantiation
        of any of these classes with a different name, just return the pre-existing instance.
        </li>

        <li>The attributes of "Stats" and "Conn" are read-only &mdash; writes
        can be quietly discarded. This restriction does not apply to
        "Fleet".</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You may assume that user-defined absolute names will be at most 50
    characters long.</p>

    <h2 id="output-format">Output Format</h2>You are required to follow the
    output format for attribute values detailed below. Any deviation from this
    format will result in lost points.

    <h3>Numeric Format</h3>

    <p>For each numeric value, output the result as a string with no linebreaks
    or whitespace. For instance, if there are 10 Truck segments in the shipping
    network, a stats query for "Truck segment" should result in the output
    <i>"10"</i>.</p>

    <p>Notice that there are <b>neither leading nor trailing whitespaces</b>.
    Integer-only numbers (such as a capacity attribute) should be printed
    without a decimal, but floating-point types (such as MPH) should always be
    printed with 2 decimal digits (rounded).</p>

    <p>The value of the "expedite percentage" attribute should be between 0.00
    and 100.00 and rounded to 2 decimal points. For instance, if there are 3
    out of 7 expediting segments, output <i>"42.86"</i>. Note that <b>there is
    no % symbol</b>. In any case, <b>do not output extra lines</b>.</p>

    <h3>Connectivity Format</h3>

    <p>For both <i>connect</i> and <i>explore</i> queries, the paths should not
    visit a location more than once. Also, if there is more than one path to
    the same location, then all the paths should be returned, with each path on
    its own line.</p>

    <p>Here is a sample <i>explore</i> output with two possible paths from loc0
    to loc3:<br /></p>
    <pre>
loc0(seg0:len0:seg0')<b>^</b>loc1(seg1:len1:seg1')<b>^</b>loc2(seg2:len2:seg2')<b>^</b>loc3<b>$</b>
loc0(seg3:len3:seg3')<b>^</b>loc3<b>$</b>
</pre>

    <p>and here is a sample <i>connect</i><!--<b>(Group only)</b>--> output with two possible paths from
    loc0 to loc3:<br /></p>
    <pre>
cost<b>^</b>time<b>^</b>expedited;<b>^</b>loc0(seg0:len0:seg0')<b>^</b>loc1(seg1:len1:seg1')<b>^</b>loc2(seg2:len2:seg2')<b>^</b>loc3<b>$</b>
cost<b>^</b>time<b>^</b>expedited;<b>^</b>loc0(seg3:len3:seg3')<b>^</b>loc3<b>$</b>
</pre>In the examples above, <b>^ is a single space</b> and <b>$ is a single
newline</b> (don't actually print ^ or $!). There should be no other leading or
trailing whitespace. Note that, as a floating-point value, the lengths should
be printed to 2 decimals.

    <h2 id="programming-style">Programming Style</h2>

    <p>You are expected to read and apply the material of Chapters 1 through 4
    to this assignment. Use the attribute-based approach described in Chapter
    2.</p>

    <p>We are providing a client program which should aid you in testing your
    library. We encourage you to exercise any specified library services that
    our client program does not invoke (by modifying the test client or
    replacing it with your own client program), as they will be exercised
    during the grading of this assignment.</p>

    <p>Try to model your code as a shared library. This means that any test
    programs you write must use the shippingInstanceManager() entry point to
    get a handle on the Shipping::Manager object, and after that must only use
    the interface specified in the Instance.h header file we provided. The code
    links as a static executable because this will be much easier for you to
    debug, but our goal is to design code that could be loaded as a shared
    library.</p>

    <p>This assignment is not meant to test error handling, so you may handle
    unanticipated errors (e.g., running out of memory) by any reasonable means
    you choose. One good way is to use exceptions &mdash; but we have not
    covered them yet in class. An alternative is to print an error message to
    stderr and attempt to continue on. Please indicate the method you use for
    handling unanticipated errors in your README file.</p>

    <p>Another important issue not tested in this assignment is memory
    management. Although not covered yet in class, you are strongly encouraged
    to use the smart pointer reference counting technique from Chapter 5 of
    your course reader. We provided you with the relevant source code in
    Assignment 2 and will give plenty of examples, so don't worry &mdash; smart
    pointers are easy to use and will not get in the way.</p>

    <h2 id="milestone-requirements">Milestone Requirements</h2>

    <p>You will be required to come up with a description of the interface you
    will implement between the rep and engine layers. You need to provide a
    list of classes, their attributes, and the public methods exposed to the
    rep layer by the engine. None of those methods need to be implemented at
    this point, we are only concerned with the design of the interface for the
    milestone. This is due Friday, October 28, but we encourage you to finish
    it and submit it to us as soon as you can so that we can provide feedback
    and you can start the implementation as soon as possible. Please type this
    up and attach it in an email to the course staff list
    (cs249a-staff@cs.stanford.edu). This interface does not need to
    be perfect, and you may modify it after you turn it in, we just want to
    make sure you're heading in the right direction.</p>

    <p>Additionally, you are required to have your teams fixed by this point.
    Please include your partner's name in the email submission.</p>

    <h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

    <p>Only one group member needs to submit the final code. Submit the
    assignment using the /usr/class/cs249a/bin/submit program. Your submission
    must include the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Complete source code, including the sample client program</li>

        <li>A Makefile that builds your code and the sample client program.
        <b>Update:</b> The Makefile must have a target for a program named
        "test1" that builds using "test1.cpp", with "test1.cpp" containing
        main().  The starter Makefile already does this, so take care when 
        modifying it.</li>

        <li>A README file that describes your class hierarchy and analyzes the
        design issues that affect your class library. Please include on the
        first line the submitting student's SUNet ID in the format "user:
        <var>id</var>", where <var>id</var> is your SUNet ID. The second line
        of the README should be the non-submitting partner's SUNet ID in the
        same format.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The source bundle for this assignment includes the Instance.h header
    file, which is the immutable contract between the client code and the rep
    layer, and also some sample code in Instance.cpp, which is intended as a
    starting point for you, and which you will need to change!</p>

    <p>You may re-submit as many times as you like. If you re-submit a file,
    the new version will overwrite the old one.</p>

    <h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>10%: Reasonable submission for milestone. This will be credit/no
        credit.</li>

        <li>40%: Class hierarchy and library design. Is it clear and
        appropriate, efficient, extendable, flexible, etc.</li>

        <li>25%: Programming style, readability, and documentation.</li>

        <li>25%: Overall correctness of the class support. Does it work?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Here is an example of how to use the Nominal or Ordinal types:
            <pre>

        class Mile : public Nominal&lt;Mile, unsigned int&gt; {
        public:
                Mile(unsigned int num) : Nominal&lt;Mile, unsigned int&gt;(num) {
                        //can do additional checks on bounds here
                }
        };

        ...

        class Segment {
        private:
                Mile distance_;
        public:
                //initialization of distance_ is required.
                Segment() : distance_(1) {
                        //Segment constructor stuff...
                }
        };

        
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>Since the segmentN attribute of a location is read-only (at least
        from the client side) the only way to have this set is to set the
        source attribute of a segment. This should implicitly assign that
        segment to the greatest unused number. For example, if loc3 has 3
        segment already attached to it, and we do this:
            <pre>

        seg4-&gt;attributeIs("source", "loc3");
        
</pre>then the segment4 attribute of loc3 will return seg4. If the source
attribute of a segment is set to null, this has the effect of also removing the
segment from the location, ie:
            <pre>

        seg3-&gt;attributeIs("source", "");
        
</pre>The location should "shift-down" the segment numbers to fill in the gaps.
In this case,
            <pre>

        loc3-&gt;attribute("segment3");
        
</pre>now will return seg4.
        </li>
    </ul>
